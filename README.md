# DATA-SCIENCE-TRENDS-OF-THE-FUTURE
Data Science is one of the most exciting fields for entrepreneurs as it combines the future with how companies, societies, and policy's function. Data science is a field which incorporates the use of scientific methods, processes, algorithms to gather knowledge from all kinds of data and has application in a numerous number of domains. Data Science is expected to explode in the near future and it will open new jobs and opportunities for people.
AUGMENTED DATA MANAGEMENT
AI-human hybrid is rising and ensuing. ADM uses Machine Learning and AI techniques to improve our output in operations. As a revolution in Data Management takes place automation incorporates in our jobs and reduces the work load on humans.
SCALABLE AI
Data science is evolving day by day, AI and machine learning get incorporated into every job sector. There are about 12000 AI startups in the world according to NVIDIA. There is an uprise in the use of AI which will take us to Scalable AI.
Capitalism surrounding scalable AI can be called as augmented surveillance capitalism. The IOT also is getting incorporated in our daily lives.
One of the main reasons students get into data sciences is Scalable AI. All kinds of data unite as AI combines with many new and old features of our lives to give us how we can manipulate the flow of data and predict it side by side.
AUGMENTED CUSTOMER INTERFACES
In the future its very improbable that we will be served by humans. Its highly likely that we will be catered to by a virtual assistant who will guide us and give us the required information.
Top companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft are incorporating AI on a massive scale, video call applications or E-Commerce websites of today can be changed by Augmented Consumer Interfaces.
Amazon has launched its miniâ€“Amazon Go stores where the human force has been replaced by augmented interfaces.
AI-As-a-Service Platforms
As machine learning and data science grows, more AI- as-Service platforms will become a reality. This will lead to more accessible and affordable AI and even small entrepreneurs will get hands on it.
Platforms like Lightspeed, Shopify and others are helping small businesses optimized with Artificial Intelligence to grow quickly.
Leaders like Google, Microsoft have tremendous capacity to produce AI-AS-A-SERVICE at a rate for consumers to get their hands on this new technology.
The biggest growth in Data Sciences can be seen in AI-AS-A-SERVICES.
The Democratization of AI
Data Science and ML knowledge workers wages are hugely different in different areas of the world.
Companies in some regions of the world will not have same accessibility to data science compared to countries in North America and Europe.
Equal opportunities and benefits are the main ideas behind Democratization. It is the most important goal of the 21st century. Social Justice, Wealth and equal opportunities is highly important in a data driven world.
The main idea behind this is that anyone from anywhere can become a data science student and become an expert in ML, AI and programming.
PYTHON
Python Programming Language is the mainly used language by ML and Data Science Professionals. It showcases how data science is a global community because of Python's libraries and support system. Python comes loaded with many languages and libraries and thus making it an easy choice for getting into AI. 
ANALYTICS REVOLUTION
Improved data and analytics make better business decisions. The revolution in the analytics makes the data more attainable to the society and allows businessmen, countries, cities and villages get access to data and make use of it. 
CLOUD COMPUTING WITH EXPONENTIAL AI
Cloud computing and machine learning together can lead to something very big. It can create jobs, and adds value to AI. The convergence of AI, CLOUD, AND DATASCIENCES can be the next big thing.
Quantum computing could become a reality which would lead to a new era of data science, AI AND ML.
All this is possible due to the fact that Cloud is evolving at such a high pace.
CONCLUSION
AI, ML and Data Sciences are our future. These things will lead to a more advanced and technologically advanced future. In the future we will see them in our daily lives and everything around us will be a direct result of <a href=https://www.apponix.com/data-science-courses>Data Science</a>.
